# AI Neural Network Framework

An advanced AI neural network framework implemented in Go, designed for building flexible, modular, and customizable neural network architectures. The framework supports a wide range of neuron types, distributed computing capabilities, and quantum-inspired features, enabling the creation of next-generation neural networks.

## Overview

This framework provides an extensible platform for constructing neural networks with diverse neuron types and emergent properties, using JSON-based configurations. It includes features for modularity, distributed processing, and dynamic adaptability.

### Supported Neuron Types
- **Input Neurons**: Accept input data to the network.
- **Dense (Fully Connected) Neurons**: Standard neurons connected to all neurons in the previous layer.
- **Recurrent Neurons (RNN)**: Maintain state across time steps, ideal for sequential data processing.
- **Long Short-Term Memory Neurons (LSTM)**: Advanced recurrent neurons capable of learning long-term dependencies.
- **Convolutional Neurons (CNN)**: Perform convolution operations, suitable for tasks like image processing.
- **Attention Mechanism Neurons**: Focus on specific parts of input data using attention-based mechanisms.
- **Dropout Neurons**: Apply dropout regularization for improving generalization.
- **Batch Normalization Neurons**: Normalize inputs to accelerate training and improve stability.
- **Neuro-Cellular Automata (NCA)**: Simulate decentralized, self-organizing systems inspired by cellular automata.
- **Quantum-Inspired Neurons**: Enable quantum-like behaviors, including superposition and entanglement, for probabilistic processing.
- **Output Neurons**: Provide the final outputs of the network.

### Distributed Features
- **Sharding**: Divide neural networks into shards, enabling layer-by-layer distributed computation.
- **Client-Side WebAssembly**: Run shards directly in web browsers for decentralized, scalable computation.
- **Dynamic Evolution**: Incrementally evolve network architectures by mutating layers and connections.
- **Resilience**: Support for recovery and continuity in distributed environments.

### Core Functionalities
- **Customizable Neurons**: Define neurons with specific attributes such as types, biases, activation functions, and connections.
- **JSON Configuration**: Load and modify network architectures using JSON files.
- **Activation Functions**: Support for ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Leaky ReLU, ELU, Softmax, and Linear functions.
- **Forward Propagation**: Efficiently process inputs through neurons, maintaining states for recurrent and quantum neurons.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Implement attention models for tasks requiring dynamic focus on inputs.
- **Emergent Behavior Simulation**: Explore emergent properties from complex neuron interactions, such as self-organization and adaptive patterns.

## Key Features

1. **Network Definition**: Use JSON to define neurons, connections, and configurations.
2. **Dynamic Configuration**: Load JSON files to modify network structure without altering the source code.
3. **Distributed Execution**: Divide networks into shards for efficient processing on multiple devices.
4. **Evolution and Mutation**: Evolve network architecture by dynamically adding or modifying neurons and connections.
5. **Emergent Behaviors**: Simulate interactions to observe adaptive or self-organizing phenomena.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup**: Install Go and set up a Go module for your project.
2. **Define Network**: Create a JSON configuration with neuron definitions and connections.
3. **Initialize Framework**: Load the configuration and initialize the network.
4. **Run Inference**: Provide input data and run the network for the desired number of timesteps.
5. **Utilize Outputs**: Retrieve outputs from the network’s output neurons.
6. **Distributed Deployment**: Split layers into shards for deployment across multiple nodes or browsers.

## Future Work
